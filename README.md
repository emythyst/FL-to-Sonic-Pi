# FL-to-Sonic-Pi
Programming songs I wrote in FL Studio in Sonic Pi
I've had a youtube channel with my weird music on it for many years. I still have a long way to go before I achieve a professional sound. I seem to be good at catchy melodies though. :) 

Here's a link to my videos:

Eventually I'd like to make more original compositions in Sonic Pi but for now I'm working with what I've already made. Will update this as I progress. Enjoy!
